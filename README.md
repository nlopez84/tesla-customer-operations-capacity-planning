# Tesla Customer Operations Capacity & Expansion Analytics

## Business Context
Tesla’s customer-facing operations (Sales, Delivery, Service, Collision, and Customer Support) must scale in parallel with rapid demand growth while maintaining operational efficiency and a high-quality customer experience.

North America Business Planning plays a critical role in aligning long-term growth priorities with day-to-day operational execution. This project simulates that function by analyzing demand signals, operational capacity, and performance metrics across U.S. markets to identify expansion priorities and operational improvement opportunities.

## Objective
Evaluate where customer demand is outpacing operational capacity and develop data-driven recommendations to guide expansion, staffing, and process improvement decisions across Tesla’s customer-facing portfolio.

## Key Questions
- Which U.S. markets are experiencing sustained customer demand growth?
- Where is operational capacity becoming constrained?
- Which locations and teams present the highest risk to customer experience?
- What investments (capacity, staffing, or systems) deliver the highest operational ROI?

## Methodology
- Aggregated demand signals using SQL and Excel
- Scenario-based forecasting (low / base / high growth)
- Capacity utilization modeling at the metro level
- Qualitative analysis of customer feedback to identify operational bottlenecks
- Business case development to evaluate expansion and improvement initiatives

## Key Outputs
- Demand growth and capacity forecast models
- Location performance scorecards
- Executive-ready dashboards and summaries
- Data-backed business cases for operational investments

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (forecasting, scenario modeling)
- SQL (data aggregation and analysis)
- Tableau / Power BI (executive dashboards)
- Python (optional: forecasting and text analysis)

## Disclaimer
This project uses publicly available and synthetic data to simulate Tesla’s customer operations environment. It is intended solely for analytical demonstration purposes.
