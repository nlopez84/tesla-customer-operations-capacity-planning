# Assumptions & Limitations

## Dataset: U.S. Electric Vehicle Registrations by State

### Key Assumptions
- EV registrations are used as a proxy for Tesla customer demand
- State-level data is assumed to reflect regional service and delivery demand
- Growth in EV registrations correlates with increased demand for customer-facing operations (delivery, service, support)

### Limitations
- Data is aggregated at the state level and does not reflect city- or store-level demand
- Registrations include all EV manufacturers, not Tesla exclusively
- Time lag may exist between vehicle registration and demand for service capacity

### Mitigations
- Results will be interpreted directionally rather than as precise forecasts
- Findings will be combined with additional demand proxies in later analysis phases
