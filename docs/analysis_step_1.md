# Analysis Step 1: Current EV Demand Concentration

## Question
Which U.S. states currently represent the highest EV demand?

## Method
- Used state-level EV registration counts
- Sorted states by total registration count (descending)
- Identified top demand markets

## Key Insight
EV demand is concentrated in a limited number of states, indicating that customer-facing operations (delivery, service, support) are likely under the greatest capacity pressure in these regions.

## Implication for Tesla
States with the highest EV registrations should be prioritized for:
- Service center capacity planning
- Delivery infrastructure
- Customer support staffing
